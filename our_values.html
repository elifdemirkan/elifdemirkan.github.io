<p>PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY
<br>
<p>Today, we all know how important healthy food consumption is for a healthy individual. However, it is very important that this awareness becomes widespread in the field. As HATSU, we strive to ensure that this awareness is fully embodied in all our teammates, both around our business and in the production phase. It is of great importance that it is delivered to the final consumer in an appropriate way. As HATSU, we attach great importance to the production of our products in accordance with all hygiene rules and to carry out these transfers with the most modern tools in order to avoid the slightest mistake in product transfers.
<br><br>
<p>QUALITY POLICY
<br>
<p> As HATSU aquaculture processing integrated facility, we work with a dynamic team that can adapt to flexible working conditions in line with the demands of customers, constantly renews itself with periodic in-service trainings, and strives to do its job meticulously to meet the expectations of the customers, using equipment complying with EU norms. We constantly keep ourselves open to inspections in almost every subject, especially in environmental health and occupational safety issues, and we carry out our production by adapting all the conditions required by the legislation to our production processes.
<br><br>
<p>HYGIENE POLICY
<br>
<p>In order to deliver the products we produce to our customers in the healthiest and most hygienic way, we are extremely meticulous both in our production stages and in our transfer and supply processes. Our products, which we deliver to the final consumer both in our showcase products and with our cold chain vehicles, are consumed with appreciation and are constantly in demand. All of our teammates working at the HATSU aquaculture integrated facility attend hygiene trainings periodically, and audits are requested from contracted companies at certain periods in order to keep our production areas hygienic.
